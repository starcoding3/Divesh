What is a PURE AGENT?
In a pure agentic system LLM decides everything like this:
	When to call tools
	Which tool to call
	What order to call them
	How many times to call tools
	When reasoning is “done”
The LLM drives the process, like:
	LLM → Tool → LLM → Tool → LLM → ... → Final Answer

This is often called:
	ReAct (Reason + Act)
	Tool Calling loops
	Autonomous agents

LLM is in control. We give it tools, and it chooses the flow dynamically.

What is a SIMPLE WORKFLOW?
A simple workflow is the opposite. Developer decides the whole flow:
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → END

No decisions by the LLM.
No tool choice by the LLM.
Everything is deterministic.

Hybrid approach:
Our system is hybrid because:
	1. The outer structure (architecture generation → diagram → NFR review)
	is controlled by a deterministic workflow, not the LLM.

	2. The inner logic of each step
	uses an LLM behaving like a domain-specific mini-agent.

	3. The LLM does not choose tools or call steps dynamically —
	but it performs intelligent reasoning within each step.

So it’s a precise combination of:
🟦 Workflow for orchestration
🟩 Agent-like intelligence inside each LLM call

That’s why it’s not pure agentic — and not pure workflow — but a hybrid agent system.

Agentic vs Hybrid approach:
Pure agents are:
	Harder to control
	Prone to hallucinating tool usage
	Sometimes get stuck in loops
	Less predictable timing
	Hard to debug

Hybrid approach gives:
	✔ Stability
	✔ Predictability
	✔ Clear user experience
	✔ Statefulness (thanks to LangGraph + MemorySaver)
	✔ Two expert-agent steps (Architecture + NFR)
	✔ Zero chance of agent loops
